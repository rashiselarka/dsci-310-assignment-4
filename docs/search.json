    "text": "Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Horse populations for all provinces in Canada from 1906 - 1972.\n\n\n\nWe can see from Figure 1 that Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta have had the highest horse populations in Canada. All provinces have had a decline in horse populations since 1940. This is likely due to the rebound of the Canadian automotive industry after the Great Depression and the Second World War. An interesting follow-up visualisation would be car sales per year for each Province over the time period visualised above to further support this hypothesis.\nSuppose we were interested in looking in more closely at the province with the highest spread (in terms of standard deviation) of horse populations. We present the standard deviations in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Standard deviation of historical (1906-1972) horse populations for each Canadian province.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvince\nStd\n\n\n\n\nSaskatchewan\n377266\n\n\nOntario\n266435\n\n\nAlberta\n266063\n\n\nManitoba\n122404\n\n\nQuebec\n111411\n\n\nNew Brunswick\n22019.5\n\n\nNova Scotia\n19879.3\n\n\nBritish Columbia\n14945.7\n\n\nP.E.I.\n11355.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we define standard deviation (of a sample) as\n\\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{N-1} }\\]\nAdditionally, note that in Table 1 we consider the sample standard deviation of the number of horses during the same time span as Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Horse populations for the province with the largest standard deviation\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2 we zoom in and look at the province of Saskatchewan, which had the largest spread of values in terms of standard deviation."
